# Map geolocated IP addresses with leaflet, DT and flexdashboard

This is the outcome of using generator to generate fake IP addresses, then freegeoip to geolocate them, leaflet to map them, DT to display them as tabular data and flexdashboard. for a nice layout. The data is completely made up and meaningless. The groups and battery status are arbitrary and were assigned randomly.
